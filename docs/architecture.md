# Cogniflux Architecture

## Streaming Cognitive Signals

```
User Input → Signal Detection → Confluent Kafka → Live Memory Engine → Adaptive Gemini Response
```

**Components:**
- **Signal Detection**: Real-time analysis of user interaction patterns
- **Confluent Kafka**: Streaming layer for cognitive signals
- **Live Memory Engine**: Inference-time cognitive state computation
- **Adaptive AI**: Gemini responses steered by cognitive memory

**Key Innovation:** No model retraining required - intelligence adapts at inference time through streaming cognitive signals.
